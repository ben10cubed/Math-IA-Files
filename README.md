# Math-IA-Files
Here are the programs and photos used for my Maths IA.
There are quite a few programs that were used. Here are some guides to run them if required.

# Strealine Files
These files contain programs that generate the data required to plot streamlines.
As the name of the files suggest, "Euler Polynomial" is for the polynomial model while "Euler Sin" is for the sin model.
To run this, please put each of these folders in a separate, newly created folder. These generate quite a lot of text files.
To compile the data into an Excel spreadsheet, copy the "excelCreate" file into the respective directories and run the program.
