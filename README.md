# Math-IA-Files
Here are the programs and photos used for my Maths IA.
There are quite a few programs that were used. Here are some guides to run them if required.

# Ocean Current Picture
The pic.PNG file contains an image of the ocean currents from the Earth Nullschool website.
This has been properly credited in my IA document, but here is the citation:

# Streamline Files
These files contain programs that generate the data required to plot streamlines.
As the name of the files suggest, "Euler Polynomial" is for the polynomial model while "Euler Sin" is for the sin model.
To run this, please put each of these folders in a separate, newly created folder. These generate quite a lot of text files.
To compile the data into an Excel spreadsheet, copy the "excelCreate" file into the respective directories and run the program.

With the Excel spreadsheet, the MATLAB program "Eulers.m" can be used. This file should be in its own file as well.
pic.PNG and the Excel spreadsheet should be copied into this trajectory.
Simply run the program and the streamlines should be drawn.
I am unable to provide all iterations of this program but for some instances, the color of the lines can be changed manually.
